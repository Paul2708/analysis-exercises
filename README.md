# analysis-exercises
A huge set of analysis exam exercises with result and hints.

The main language in the document is German. 
Anyways you should be able to get the questions and their answers.

## Content
- Folgen und Reihen
- Grenzwerte und Stetigkeit
- Riemann-Integral
- Fourierreihe
- ...
- DGL 1. Ordnung
- DGL n. Ordnung

The questions are based on exams from "Höhere Mathematik 1 & 2 (für Informatiker)" @KIT.
As I copied every question by hand, there may be missing symbols, typos and wrong answers (and perhaps wrong questions).
If you found any issues, please report them to me. :heart:

## Current version
A current version can be found [here](https://github.com/Paul2708/analysis-exercises/releases).

## Build it
If you want to edit/build the file locally, you have to clone the repository.
To build it, you can use every TeX-Editor you want.
I use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org) (Windows) and build the file by `pdflatex.exe -synctex=1 -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode --aux-directory=build "main".tex`

## Questions?
If you don't get any questions or something else is unclear, just open an issue.
I will try to figure it out with you.
